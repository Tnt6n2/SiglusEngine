# SiglusEngine
Feel free to download it before it dies from cringe. I will push a backup if this repo dies.

- This repository contains full source code of VisualArt's SiglusEngine. 
- In order to build this repository you must fix the source code by yourself, which is not too hard.

Note: This will not works for newer games that got released after 2021 due to new system call(syscall)

# Why do i release the source code?
- If it's not me then there will be others.
- Actually, a lot of people already got the leak, so i will just directly upload it to GitHub for easy access.
# Contact
- My github is enough for y'all.

Feel free to hate me, i do what i want.
